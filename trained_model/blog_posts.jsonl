Lecturers and dental professionals alike can implement the technology within the Immersify platform, and TePe’s content to further develop their understanding of Oral Health, the teaching methods and content around that, and disseminate their knowledge when treating patients.\nFor students, this partnership offers a comprehensive learning experience covering an additional area of dentistry that supports their understanding and knowledge of oral health. This not only complements their overall studies but also equips them with the knowledge and skills they can transfer to the professional world and help continue to build their confidence.\nTogether, Immersify and Tepe aim to provide a comprehensive educational experience that not only teaches the importance of oral care but also inspires a lifelong commitment to it. We look forward to the outcomes that this partnership will have on the dental community and the positive impact it will bring to oral health education.\nFrom the team at Immersify, we are excited to be partnering with Tepe, as we share our collective vision to bring quality resources to professionals and students. Keep your eyes peeled: we will be sharing more details about our collaboration soon. In the meantime, go to the Immersify platform to explore amazing content."}]}

For nearly a century, Septodont have continued to provide dental products on a global scale and produce innovative solutions to advance healthcare services.\n\nBiodentine, an innovative bioactive dentine substitute\nSeptodont have spent the last decade researching and developing Biodentine.\n\nThis breakthrough technology has a positive effect on the living tissue of the tooth and remineralises the tooth structure, protecting the pulp. Biodentine is the first all-in-one dentine substitute offering bioactivity and outstanding sealing properties to fully replace dentine, both in the crown and root of the tooth; wherever dentine is damaged.\n\nBiodentine can be used in these areas of dentistry:\n\n💡 Restorative\n\n💡 Paediatric\n\n💡 Endodontics\n\nBiodentine provides its best when used in a bio-bulk fill procedure, from the pulp to the top thanks to the unique combination of great biocompatibility/bioactivity and strong mechanical properties (final enamel restoration to be completed within 6 months). As such Biodentine is an appropriate solution for daily procedures such as deep caries (direct or indirect pulp capping) or even pulpotomies (reversible/irreversible pulpitis).\n\nOur new partnership comes at an exciting time for Biodentine. Stay tuned!\n\nWhat this partnership means for our community\nOur renewed partnership with Septodont will result in additional quality content being provided for our community of dental professionals. With Septodont being an industry leader and innovator, the dentistry content developed in partnership will continue to enable our community to experience modern dentistry concepts and how they will be a part of their professional career.\n\nWhat this partnership means for our educators\nMore dentistry content means additional resources are available for our educators. This means that lecturers, tutors and dental professionals will be able to incorporate cutting-edge technology and dentistry concepts within their training or course curriculum.\n\nThe aim of this new content is to cover three main areas, these being:\n\n💜 General dental materials\n\n💜 Calcium Silicate based materials – where it started\n\n💜 The advent of Biodentine\n\nImmersify come in by integrating these concepts in educational resources within the Immersify Platform, allowing educators to utilise these resources within their teaching to their students and trainees.\n\nExisting Septodont content in Immersify\nThis is not the first time we collaborate with Septodont; our existing content includes a practical experience called Local Analgesia, which our community of Immersifyers call LA.\n\nThis piece of dentistry content requires individuals to apply their knowledge of anaesthetics, from the location to administration of the correct dosage – all to control the level of their patient’s pain undergoing a procedure.\n\nTip for dental students:\n\nThis experience provides you with relevant, transferrable skills that you will need once you qualify.\n\nTip for dental educators:\n\nYour students or trainees will develop their decision-making and confidence through undergoing this experience.\n\nAdditional Septodont content coming to Immersify!\nComing later in March 2023, the additional Septodont content will involve an overview of dental materials. For now, this content will include:\nProperties and safety of dental materials\nBioactive Materials, which will showcase Calcium Silicate Based Cements and Septodont’s Biodentine\nAnd soon, we will integrate:\nComposite, GI and Bonding\nAmalgam and Temporary Cements\nTip for dental students:\nDevelop your understanding of dental materials and when best to use them; as you’ll need this knowledge to bring your patients dental health back to an optimum level.\nTip for dental educators:\nUtilise detailed imagery and resources within your teaching to help your students or trainees to visualise these processes.\nImmersify Education has been impressive in developing and deploying innovative high-quality content for dental education. It has been an obvious move for Septodont to enter a collaboration with Immersify and further extend it, understanding the synergy and vision of both companies. For years, Septodont has been striving to provide education beyond manufacturing products, starting with the “Managing Pain for Your Practice” program, and this extended partnership brings our approach to another level.\nJerome Haas"}]}
